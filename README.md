# Hi, I'm Travis Hanson.
You found me! Thanks for checking out my bio.

## About Me

- I spent my formative years in Gillette, Wyoming but most of my adult life has been in Northeast Nebraska between Norfolk and Pierce.
    - I have a wife and three adult children.

- I work in Norfolk for Vulcraft which is a division of Nucor Steel.
    - I have been with them since 2003.
    - I spent 4 1/2 years as a Design Engineer designing joists for schools, and commercial buildings.
    - I spent around 2 1/2 years in Research and Development performing various tasks.
    - I eventually started developing on our custom joist design software.
    - Now I am the Dev Team lead for Vulcraft's Engineering Tools dev team developing the joist design software.

- I am continuing my education to pursue a Masters in Software Engineering.
    - My job could benefit from having a formal education in the types of tasks I currently do to manage a development team.
    - More and more of what we're doing involves project management and collaboration between different teams.

- The fundamental skill I use everyday is to examine a problem or requirement and be able to break it down into smaller actionable steps.
    - This was a learned skill that I developed while learning to write code and to lead teams.
