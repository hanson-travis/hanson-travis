# Travis Hanson

Hello! I'm Travis Hanson, a civil engineer with a passion for continuous learning. I'm currently a Development Team Lead at Vulcraft (a division of Nucor), where I work on custom engineering design tools for open web steel joists. Alongside work, I'm knocking out a couple of required undergraduate courses I need before I begin pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering. In order to continue being a good leader, I need to continue building a strong technical foundation. This GitHub space is where I explore ideas, experiment, and build hobby projects.

## Professional Experience

I’m a mid-career engineer and team lead with a background that blends structural engineering and software development. At Vulcraft, I lead the Engineering Tools development team, focused on building and modernizing internal joist design software used by engineers across the organization.

My role today is less about writing production code every day and more about breaking down complex problems, guiding technical direction, and helping teams turn ideas into working systems. That said, I still enjoy getting my hands dirty when I can.

## Education & Continuing Learning

I’m currently continuing my education with the goal of earning a Master’s degree in Software Engineering. As part of that path, I recently completed a fundamentals of programming course and am now enrolled in **Programming Fundamentals II**, which focuses on object-oriented programming using Java.

The coursework covers core OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism), SOLID principles, interfaces, generics, collections, and basic GUI development using JavaFX. While I’ve worked in software for years, these classes are helping me formalize concepts I learned organically and fill in gaps I never had time to revisit earlier in my career.

## Personal Projects

This GitHub account is intentionally personal and exploratory. The projects here are less about showcasing perfect code and more about exploring ideas I find interesting.

So far, I’ve built:
- **A pool shot clock timer** — inspired by competitive billiards and the idea of enforcing pace of play.
- **A pool-themed puzzle game** — a small logic-driven game aimed at pool players, built more as a creative experiment than a polished product.

Many of these projects were completed using modern AI-assisted tools to accelerate learning and prototyping. Over time, I plan to revisit and refine them as my skills and ideas evolve.

## Personal Background

I grew up in Gillette, Wyoming, and have spent most of my adult life in northeast Nebraska. I’m married and have three adult children.

Outside of software, I enjoy:
- Playing and competing in billiards
- Watching my daughters play fastpitch softball
- Listening to music (with broad tastes)
- Thinking about systems — whether they involve code, sports, or problem-solving in general
